This website expects you to be able to type in answers in Japanese. The Genki textbooks might start you off gently with Romaji, but みんあの日本語 expects you to immediately begin using Japanese writing systems.

It's pretty easy to install and begin using a Japanese keyboard. 

## For Mac users

1. Go to Settings -> Keyboard -> Input Sources -> Edit...
2. Hit the plus at the bottom left of the new window.
3. Scroll down to Japanese and select `Japanese - Romaji`.

Before you close out of the window, I have a few personal suggestions.

- Under Input Modes, check only the box for hiragana. You'll still be able to type katakana and kanji with it no problem.
- Set the Shift Key action to Type Katakana. This is a quick way to bypass the suggestion window and only get katakana when you need it.
- You can play with the other settings if you want. Personally, I only have Correct Spelling checked.

Now you can alternate between your input modes by hitting your globe key. There's a white box in your status bar that alternates between A and あ depending on what mode you're in.

## For Windows users

While Windows does ship with Japanese support, I actually suggest downloading Google's Japanese keyboard instead from [here](https://www.google.co.jp/ime/). The primary reason is that Google's IME will remember your last selected mode between romaji and kana, while Microsoft's doesn't and you have to manually toggle it every time.

1. Download the Google IME from the link above and install it.
2. You're pretty much done!

You alternate between input modes by hitting Alt+Shift. You can also rebind this in the Windows settings if you want. Within the Japanese mode, you can toggle between romaji mode and kana mode by hitting Alt+` (the backtick symbol to the left of 1 on a standard QWERTY keyboard, your key may be different on other keyboards). The romaji mode also works fine as a regular English input, I've forgotten I've left it in that mode many times and never had an issue, even with very character-sensitive projects like developing this website.

## Why the Romaji keyboard?

I highly suggest using Romaji input over the kana keyboard, particularly if you don't already own a kana keyboard. It's not worth the extra expense, as someone that actually owns one. Learning the kana keyboard means having to re-memorize where every character is. You might eventually even become as fast as you were the other way, but you're out 50 bucks, or more if you own a Mac and want things to match (they're like $200 with the Touch ID). But it's unlikely, if you've been typing your whole life, that you'll ever be *faster* on a Kana keyboard than you were on a regular QWERTY.

Also, if you plan on using a kana keyboard to type in English, it's actually super annoying, like having to hit Shift+7 for an apostrophe.

Lastly, QWERTY keyboards are flat-out more common in Japan than kana keyboards are, so you don't even gain anything there. Romaji mode is *the* most common way for actual Japanese people to type Japanese.

(The exception to this is on your phone. I recommend installing a 12-key Japanese keyboard on your phone if you're wanting to text in Japanese or use the Discord app or something for only one hypothetical scenario: You're in Japan, you need help from a Japanese person, and you hand them your phone. If you only have a Romaji keyboard, they'll probably assume it's an English QWERTY keyboard and further assume you want them to type in English. If you don't see yourself ever being in Japan, then ignore that and just use Romaji everywhere. But if it's possible, it's probably worth learning 12-key, it's incredibly fast once you've mastered it.)

## Using the keyboard

Once you're in the Japanese mode, typing in Japanese is just typing in the romaji that makes up the word or words you want. As you type, a section of text will be underlined. You can then hit the down arrow to get a list of suggestions for what that hiragana might also be (on some setups you may need to hit Tab to get this list to first pop up). You navigate that list with the up and down arrow keys, and when you find what you're looking for, you hit Enter. When typing in a section of hiragana that should stay that way, I recommend hitting Enter before moving on to other words that are katakana or kanji. Hitting Enter frequently as you go makes it less likely to have the system screw up a bunch of text at once.

A few little tips that you might not understand at first:

- You usually don't need to manually type in the small tsu (っ), just double the consonant like it's spoken and you'll get one automatically, e.g. `kekkou` -> `けっこう`.
- The を character is entered in as `wo`.
- There are some less common, or more modern, katakana that aren't always handled nicely, like `ディ`. If you try to just type in `di`, you'll get `ヂ` instead. You can always get a small vowel by typing in `x` and then the vowel, so you type in `dexi` to get `ディ`. You can also enter `dhi` to get the same thing and save a letter. I happened to learn the first one first and I've never been able to break the habit.
- Don't be afraid to type in more than you need and delete the extra stuff to get a certain kanji. This is particularly true for names. If the name is read in a way other than the common reading of the kanji, you might struggle to get it any other way.
- Some characters can be entered in slightly faster in Romaji mode by skipping a letter in the Romaji, e.g. `si` for し and `tu` for つ. The longer spelling works too, it's just a time-saver built into the IME.
