Minna No Nihongo is a series of Japanese textbooks from 3A Corporation. They were originally created in 1998 as a new take on their old Shin Nihongo No Kiso series. Minna No Nihongo is currently in its second edition, published in 2012.

Every textbook on the market is slightly different, introducing things in different orders depending primarily on the target demographic that will be reading them. For example, the Genki series by The Japan Times is aimed at college/university students, so you learn words related to the college life very early.

Minna No Nihongo is aimed at working professionals that have a need to learn Japanese, most likely because they're being assigned to work there. It tends towards introducing words that are relevant to an adult professional early. It also stresses the use of the polite form of Japanese at pretty much every opportunity, waiting until about halfway through the first book to even let you know there's a plain, less formal form. But, you can't really get in trouble at work by using the polite form.

Ganbatte exists to serve as a companion site for owners of the Minna No Nihongo textbooks. The site is nearly useless without owning them, and contains no copyrighted material, you must provide the books yourself. There are two books that are mandatory, one that's technically optional but strongly strongly recommended, and a fourth that teaches supplementary Kanji as you go through the first two.

The two mandatory books are:

- [Textbook](https://amzn.to/4lp2moJ)
- [Workbook](https://amzn.to/3Uy0saC)

These are the heart of the series. The textbook has a variety of exercises that are meant for groups but can be done solo. The workbook is full of practice exercises to check your understanding.

The strongly recommended but technically optional book is:

- [English Translation and Grammar Notes](https://amzn.to/3JlV1ZM)

If you're not working through this with a tutor, the Grammar Notes are worth the price of admission. There are grammar articles here on Ganbatte, but they'll still reference this book sometimes.

The final book in the set is:

- [Kanji](https://amzn.to/45BTNRL)

This book includes dedicated study of about 220 kanji. It introduces them in a slightly different order than the textbook does. I'm including these resources on Ganbatte because it's part of the ecosystem. I'm not convinced it's a particularly good way of learning the kanji, and you may be better off with something like [Heisig](https://amzn.to/47wxbED) if you want to do some dedicated kanji practice, but with that said, if you're just starting, I actually recommend just sticking with one set of books and flashcards, it will actually teach you at a very acceptable rate and you will be less likely to burn out.

(If you wanna ignore me and start on Heisig anyway, that's fine, but do yourself a favor and don't buy the Kindle edition, it really doesn't play nice with any actual eBook reader.)
