Before Lesson 1 your textbook shows the kana tables. I'm not going to get into the various systems of written Japanese in depth, mainly because other resources cover these so well that there's little need to. In brief, Japanese has three distinct systems for written Japanese: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji, and a standardized system for using English characters to represent Japanese sounds, Romaji.

## Hiragana

Hiragana (ひらがな) is perhaps the closest thing Japanese has to the English alphabet. In this is a set of defined characters that with it, any word in the Japanese language can technically be represented with (we will get into why it doesn't work in practice at the end.) This is the first written language taught to children, and is the first thing you should attempt to learn.

https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/ is perhaps the most rapid resource out there, aiming to teach you the 46 hiragana and their variations in as little as a few hours up to about a week.

## Katakana

Katakana (カタカナ) is actually functionally identical to hiragana, a simple table of characters that can represent every sound in Japanese. However, this set of characters is, with some exceptions that aren't really relevant to the beginner, used solely for loanwords. Just like we've imported words like baguette, Japanese has a huge variety of words from foreign languages that they make use of. These words are written in Katakana to denote this. This is probably because if they were done in Hiragana, you could end up with an infinite number of confusing sentences because this loanword happened to resemble a grammar point or vocabulary word that would skew the meaning of the sentence entirely. So if you think of it in terms like us sometimes marking brand names in italics or perhaps a trademark symbol, you get an idea of what Katakana is used for, to denote words as being just vocabulary so the meaning doesn't get misunderstood.

## Kanji

Kanji (漢字) has an interesting story right in its name. The "Kan" in Kanji is a variation of Han, as in Han-dynasty China. The "Ji" simply means character or letter. So, Han Characters. While many kanji have shifted in appearance over the centuries, they're still Chinese characters at heart, such that you might even be able to parse a little bit of Chinese and intuit the meaning, though not how it's spoken. The Japanese government produces a list of roughly 2,000 "everyday" kanji that are the only ones permitted in official documents and large publications like newspapers. This is good news if casual literacy is your aim, as there are something in excess of 50,000 of them out in the world. Take heart, though: It's very unlikely that any native speaker alive knows all of them or even a large percentage of them.

## Romaji

We'll touch on this one last as it's hard to call it a written language *per se*. Back in the 19th century, James Hepburn set out to create a system of translating Japanese sounds to English, and published his first attempt of it in 1867, with modifications happening until well after his death, with 1954 being the last time it's really been touched. There are other competing systems out there, with minor adjustments, but they all have the same goal of romanizing Japanese. Romaji is also what many native Japanese speakers use to type Japanese with, which is why it's important here. You'll also find romaji on some government forms like passports as well as being a mandatory feature on things like road signs and train stations.

As an aside here, I strongly recommend learning to type in Japanese via romaji as opposed to getting a dedicated hiragana keyboard, both because if you find yourself in Japan, the odds are reasonably good that the average computer is a good old-fashioned QWERTY keyboard, as well as that using an entirely new keyboard layout will be quite slow and frustrating. Typially, the user types in Romaji, and the system begins to suggest the matching hiragana, katakana, and kanji to turn it into, and the user chooses a suggestion from the list.

## Why not just use hiragana for everything?

It's a fair question on its face. If you've got a simple written system, why add on this additional set of thousands of Chinese characters that represent the same thing?

The reason gets into the language itself. In English, the letter *a* can be pronounced seven different ways. In Japanese, *a* always sounds like the *a* in *father*, every single time. The same goes for the other vowel sounds, and by and large the entirety of the hiragana. This is great news for learning phonics, as once you've got your hiragana down, you'll get the pronunciation of a word right the vast majority of the time.

But there's a problem with this system, and that is homophones. Japanese has a staggering amount of them. If I type "kai" into my dictionary, I get:

* Shellfish
* Meeting
* Floor or story of a building
* Idiom: "...isn't it?"
* Spoon
* Buying
* Subordinate
* Oar
* Rice Porridge
* Revision

And literally dozens of other meanings, some more or less common but all present. So, you can see the issue we have on our hands. How do you hand over the idea of a meeting instead of a shellfish? Well, you have 貝 for shellfish and 会 for meeting. That's how.

Now, this doesn't work in spoken Japanese obviously, but spoken Japanese comes with an additional amount of context based on people, locations, and objects around the speaker and listener. So you have context for spoken Japanese to help you and kanji for written Japanese to do the same.

----

Now that we've explored the various character systems, you might wonder where to start. That's actually pretty easy to answer. You need to begin with learning hiragana.

Everything grows out of this. You have to know them to form words, to use as grammar, to read, to do much of anything at all.

There are thousands of websites and mobile apps and books that will aid you in this. And for this level, many of them will get you to the same place in about the same amount of time.

For what it's worth, these are my recommendations:

- iOS: [Kana by Romain Pellen](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kana-hiragana-and-katakana/id1454200955)
- Android: [Hiragana by Faery Games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.legendarya.helloandroid&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- Mac/PC: [Japanese Basic Hiragana Anki Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2183294427)

- Web: [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/)

If using Anki, make sure you're also getting in some writing practice for the characters. You should be able to produce every one of these characters on command in either direction with a minimum of thought. Having a solid foundation here will make getting started much less painful, because you'll be able to promptly read as much as you're capable of without having to pause.

Everything you learn here is important, but I'll mention a few caveats just to cover whatever material you might be using:

* The を character, listed sometimes as "wo", "o", or "(w)o" is not used for pronouncing anything. It exists in the hiragana table because it is used to mark the object of a sentence, something you will be doing on a near-constant basis, and all of your basic grammar points are done via hiragana only. You can safely pronounce this as "o" in all cases, the difference is subtle and while some Japanese speakers might occasionally pronounce it "wo" for some stylistic reason, you'll be perfectly understandable using "o" all the time.
* The は (ha) character is also one of the more important grammar points in the language, used to mark the topic of a sentence. In these cases, it is pronounced "wa" exactly like わ. The reasons as I understand them have to do with various attempts to reform, modernize, and simplify the language over time, and they elected not to change this specific usage to わ. The complaint department for this change closed about a thousand years ago.
* Similarly, the へ (he) character is used for marking that the previous part of the sentence is involved in coming, going, or returning to a place. In those cases, it is pronounced "e" exactly like え with the same reasoning as to why.
* As you finish the basic hiragana and get into the dakuon (the " symbols placed on the right side of the hiragana to modify their sound), two of them are very rarely used: づ and ぢ. I've seen material refer to the latter as "di", "dzi", "zi", "dji", but almost never as "ji", which is essentially the actual sound of it. Now, "dzi" and "ji" are very close in sound, and we already have a "ji" in this table, じ. Same thing with "dzu" and "zu", which is covered by ず. These have a niche usage that has to do with how Japanese will connect sounds together in compound words, so while you need to know they exist, don't be surprised if you go quite a long time not using づ or ぢ. 
* The small つ (tsu) character っ is used to mark a small stop (frequently but not always a glottal stop for you linguists) in the word. Each of these hiragana should be spoken for the same interval of time, and this pause should be the same length as that.
* For something that some resources don't actually cover, there is a lengthening symbol ー that means that the preceding symbol should have it's ending sound held for the length of one additional unit of time.

And that's really it.

Next up will be the katakana, and I think this is a lot of fun to learn because unlike the hiragana, this one is immediately useful. You'll immediately be able to recognize thousands of loanwords in the Japanese language as actually just being English words written with Japanese characters.

- Web: [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/)

The list of caveats is smaller here, since katakana is not used for grammar:

* The katakana ヲ (wo) character is completely unused except when musicians or brands want to get cute. You'll never come upon it in typical written Japanese. The same goes for the rarely used ヅ and ヂ.
* The same rules for glottal stops and lengthening marks apply. The katakana equivalent to っ is ッ, and you might even notice they're both "tsu". The rules and usage is unchanged for katakana.
* Some Japanese people, particularly older ones, will write their names in katakana even though most others use kanji and/or hiragana. You should also get in the habit of writing your name in katakana, as naturalized Japanese citizens tend to take names that are written using kanji, and it may be considered pretty disrespectful for you to do so without a full understanding of the meaning and underlying culture.

How long it takes to learn these two pieces varies by how intensively you're learning, but most people can get through them in about two weeks each, and many take considerably less time than that, though they still need to be practicing quick recall of the kana.
