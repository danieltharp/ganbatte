Make sure to read the content in the Grammar Notes book right after the table of contents, from page 2 to 9. Some of it is useful information about pronunciation, some of it is some preliminary vocabulary.

I would strongly suggest not to worry too much about pitch accent and intonation yet. You can simply listen to the audio cues for the vocabulary here or in your Anki deck and work on shadowing them for both. Pitch accent can be a rabbit hole all of its own and I don't think it's a particularly useful way to spend your time until quite deep into your education, around N2 for some final polishing if needed, but if you've been listening to a lot of spoken Japanese, you've likely internalized 99% of it.

On the vocabulary section, I would study only page 7 and not bother memorizing the stuff on page 8 until some rainy day when you're done with your lesson a day or two early, and just squeeze it in when you can, it's very classroom-centric and language-centric and you can get by without it for a while.
