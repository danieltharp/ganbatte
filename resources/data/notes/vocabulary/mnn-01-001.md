While 私 is the most commonly introduced pronoun when teaching Japanese, there are others in common 
use. There's a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pronouns#Use_and_etymology) with percentages of the time a particular pronoun is used, by men and women, at various ages, and in various social contexts. It's very useful for understanding the general distribution of first-person pronouns.

Using those tables, you can conclude that 私 is slightly feminine. For the case of a learner's most likely encounter, using it with a stranger, you can see it's in use by 81% of university-age females but only 22% of university-age males. The humble-feeling ぼく (僕) and neutral じぶん (自分) are both used more, and they're not covered until lessons 20 and 24 respectively. It's my opinion that a foreign male using 私 exclusively is a subtle foreigner's mistake.

Note that the more formal わたくし and less formal あたし also use the 私 kanji, but in practice you might see any of them written using kana alone, though あたし is rarely written at all.
